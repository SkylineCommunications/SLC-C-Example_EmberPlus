> - Generic level
> - Polling via SLProtocol/SLPort
> - XML and smart-serial
> - Create generic string paths (identifiers) on discovery
> - Only the root node is being polled

## TODO

- Make sure the polling/parsing of the child nodes get implemented. This should be done on the same way like the OnNode and OnParameter methods in the low level approach.
- Add polling mechanism to poll a path discovered with the generic discovery
